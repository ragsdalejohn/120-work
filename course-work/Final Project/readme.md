I have attempted a simple game I call "RAD". The theme is 1980s nostalgia. You move the Mr. T cursor up, down, left, or right on the plane and it will continue in that direction. If it hits a wall, it bounces back. Have fun as you bounce this simple program around.

Conceptually, this is a simple sketch, but it did drive me mad to complete.
