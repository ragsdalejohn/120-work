John Ragsdale, 50

Knowing as little as I do about syntax in this p5.js enviornment, I fumbled and jumbled this together. Not necessarily meant to be crass or rude, however, it is frustrating when you have a concept in your head and translating that into code is more challenging. I have been getting help From Emily on this.

This function is supposed to call a simple senetnce, give 2 variables, add them
and produce as result. If the result is greater than 50, then answer is supposed to say "What in the ass?"
