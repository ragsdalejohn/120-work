# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--

The code is telling the program to start the ball in the upper left hand corner (at 1,1) and telling the ball to follow a diagonal path of y=x. When the ball would reduce in size (or leave the area) then the math is shifted to one of the variable getting a negative sign so the path is similiar to y=-x.

When the mouse is clicked, the direction changes by 1/2 and the speed changes by 10. WHen clicked again, will increase by same factor. When pressed a third time, the speed reduces back to 1/2.
