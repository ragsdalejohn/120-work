# Week 2 Homework Responses

## 1. This week I created respositiores and started learning the basics of coding in markdown

## 2. To complete this assignment, I had to ask for a massive extension to get the work started since I had some faily issues that kept me away from learning. When I finally settled down to work, my HP laptop with windows 10 was acting up in such a manner that I had to run out and purchase:

1) $1300 Macbook Air with:
- i7 processor
- 512 Ram
- 500GB HD
- [Link to the most expensive item I have bought for school](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-3-display-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-latest-model-silver/4600000.p?skuId=4600000)

## 3. The problems and issues listed in the response to question 2. I did not have to post in the issue tracker.

## 4. I would like to spend more time becoming comfotable with .md language and be able to know the prompts off the top of my head. This will come with time and practice.

## 5. Being so late into this I did not have the chance to assist other with issues, but hope to onced I am caught up.
